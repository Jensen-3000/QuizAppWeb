Template: only copy starting from line 6 or bracket "[":
Ask AI to generate questions and provide a filename related to the questions. 
Example: Using this template, make me 3 questions about methods in C#, with atleast 1 codesnippet and include a filename.
Place the generated content in the Assets folder with a name.json (avoid using symbols as they might not work).
And make sure to update _List of Quizzes.json, with the filename.
